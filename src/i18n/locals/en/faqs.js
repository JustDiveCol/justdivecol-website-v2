  // ----- Category 1: Courses & Certifications -----
  faqsCat1Title: 'Courses & Certifications: Your First Splash!',

  faqsCat1Q1Title: 'What certification do I need to start diving?',
  faqsCat1Q1Point1:
    "To make your first bubbles in recreational diving, the PADI Open Water Diver course is your entry ticket. It's the most popular certification on the planet and teaches you all the basics to dive safely up to 18 meters (60 feet). Get your fins ready!",

  faqsCat1Q2Title: 'What does the price of a certification course include?',
  faqsCat1Q2Point1:
    'Our courses are like an all-inclusive combo. They typically come with access to the PADI eLearning® platform, all theoretical and practical sessions (in confined water and open ocean), full top-quality equipment rental, PADI instructor accompaniment, and dive insurance during the course. Exact details for each course are in its description. No surprises underwater!',

  faqsCat1Q3Title:
    'Do I need to be a fish to dive? Do I have to know how to swim?',
  faqsCat1Q3Point1:
    "You don't need to be an Olympic champion, but yes, you do need to know how to swim! You must be comfortable in the water and able to swim 200 meters non-stop (or 300 meters with mask, fins, and snorkel) and float for 10 minutes. You don't need to be an expert swimmer, but you should be at ease in the water. It's for your safety, so practice those strokes!",

  faqsCat1Q4Title: 'What is the minimum age to join the underwater adventure?',
  faqsCat1Q4Point1:
    'For the youngest explorers, the Junior Open Water Diver certification starts at 10 years old. For the "adult" Open Water Diver and other advanced courses, the minimum age is generally 12 years or older. The passion for the sea has no age, but safety does!',

  faqsCat1Q5Title: 'Do I need to see a doctor before diving?',
  faqsCat1Q5Point1:
    'Yes, it\'s like a "check-up" for the ocean. Before any course or dive, you\'ll fill out a PADI Medical Questionnaire. If you answer "yes" to any questions (due to pre-existing conditions, for example), no worries! You\'ll just need a signed medical authorization from a doctor. It\'s a vital step for your safety, so take a look at it in advance.',

  faqsCat1Q6Title: "What if my ears don't equalize well underwater?",
  faqsCat1Q6Point1:
    "It happens to all of us! Ear equalization is a key skill in diving. Our instructors will teach you various techniques to do it correctly. If you still have difficulties, it's crucial to communicate. In some cases, persistent issues might require a medical consultation. Don't force your ears; listen to your body and your instructor!",

  faqsCat1Q7Title: 'Can I dive if I have asthma or a respiratory condition?',
  faqsCat1Q7Point1:
    "Safety first! Respiratory conditions like asthma require careful evaluation. If you have asthma or another medical condition affecting your breathing or circulation, it is mandatory that a specialist hyperbaric physician authorizes your fitness for diving. Don't take risks; your health is your greatest treasure!",

  // ----- Category 2: Dive Trips & Experiences -----
  faqsCat2Title: "Dive Trips & Experiences: Let's Explore the Blue World!",

  faqsCat2Q1Title: 'What types of dive experiences do you offer?',
  faqsCat2Q1Point1:
    'We offer a menu of adventures for all tastes: from certification trips to postcard-perfect destinations, to advanced experiences for the boldest. We love exploring vibrant reefs, historical wrecks, and encountering amazing marine life. Always with excitement as the main ingredient!',

  faqsCat2Q2Title: 'What experience level is required for your trips?',
  faqsCat2Q2Point1:
    "There's a level for every explorer! We have experiences for beginners who still smell of pool chlorine, all the way to advanced divers looking for the next big challenge. Each experience or dive site has its recommended level. For example, Malpelo is only for advanced divers with a lot of current experience – no room for novices there (yet)!",

  faqsCat2Q3Title:
    'Can I join a trip if I don\'t have a dive buddy? Am I a "Forever Alone" diver?',
  faqsCat2Q3Point1:
    "Not at all! Many of our clients travel solo and find great friends underwater. We'll take care of assigning you a certified dive buddy with a similar experience level to ensure your safety and enjoyment during dives. Here, no one dives alone unless they want to!",

  faqsCat2Q4Title: 'What should I pack for a dive trip? Just fins and go?',
  faqsCat2Q4Point1:
    "Almost! Don't forget your PADI certification (or equivalent), your updated dive logbook, personal toiletries (biodegradable, please!), comfortable clothes, swimwear, reef-friendly sunscreen, and if you have them, your personal diving gear. In each experience description, you'll find a more detailed packing list so you don't leave anything out of your suitcase (or your fins).",

  faqsCat2Q5Title:
    'Do you offer customized experiences? Can I order my adventure "à la carte"?',
  faqsCat2Q5Point1:
    "Absolutely! We love creativity and dreams. If you don't find the ideal experience on our calendar, don't hold back! Contact us, and we'll be your adventure architects. We can design a private experience or a personalized dive trip that perfectly fits your interests, skill level, and preferred dates. Your adventure, your secret recipe!",

  // ----- Category 3: Bookings & Payments -----
  faqsCat3Title: 'Bookings & Payments: Secure Your Spot in the Blue!',

  faqsCat3Q1Title: 'How can I book an experience with JustDiveCol?',
  faqsCat3Q1Point1:
    "It's easier than breathing underwater! You can book directly on our website, on each course or experience page. Or if you prefer a more personal chat, contact us via WhatsApp or email. We'll guide you step-by-step through the booking and payment process – no tangles!",

  faqsCat3Q2Title:
    'What are your payment methods? Do you accept bartering with seashells?',
  faqsCat3Q2Point1:
    'We accept modern payments, no seashells for now! You can use our secure link to pay with a domestic credit card (Visa, Mastercard), debit (PSE), or directly from your Bancolombia or Nequi account. We also accept direct bank transfers to our Bold account. Specific details are sent when you book.',

  faqsCat3Q3Title:
    'What is your cancellation and refund policy? Is it super strict?',
  faqsCat3Q3Point1:
    "Yes, to be super transparent, our policy is strict. Imagine we've already bought the bubbles for your tank and booked the boat. Due to the high operational costs of planning experiences and courses, the initial payment is non-refundable. Conditions vary greatly depending on when you cancel (more or less than 30 or 15 days in advance) and if you don't show up (No-Show). For changes due to force majeure (weather, permits), the main solution is a future credit. We strongly encourage you to read our detailed Policies section in the main menu so there are no doubts. Transparency is key!",

  // ----- Category 4: Safety & Health -----
  faqsCat4Title:
    'Diving Safety & Health: The Priority Underwater (and out of it)!',

  faqsCat4Q1Title:
    'What safety measures does JustDiveCol implement? Are they super strict?',
  faqsCat4Q1Point1:
    "More than strict, we're obsessive about your safety! We implement rigorous protocols based on PADI and DAN standards. We only use high-quality equipment with Swiss watch-like maintenance. Our PADI guides and instructors are super certified, and before each dive, we conduct detailed briefings and exhaustive pre-dive checks. And yes, we monitor you constantly underwater. We want your only concern to be enjoying yourself!",

  faqsCat4Q2Title:
    'Is dive insurance mandatory? What if a jellyfish stings me?',
  faqsCat4Q2Point1:
    "Some of our experiences, especially certifications, include dive insurance that specifically covers incidents related to the diving activity for its duration. It's a good safety net. However, we strongly recommend having additional travel insurance that offers broader coverage for general medical emergencies (like that jellyfish sting, oops!), evacuation, and cancellations. JustDiveCol is not responsible for expenses not covered by the specific dive policy or by your own insurance. Better safe than sorry!",

  faqsCat4Q3Title:
    'What happens if I have a medical emergency during an experience?',
  faqsCat4Q3Point1:
    "Our team is trained to act! Everyone is trained in first aid and emergency management. In case of any medical situation, emergency protocols will be activated, and appropriate medical attention will be sought. Remember: it's crucial that you inform us about any pre-existing medical conditions before the activity. Your well-being is our number one alarm bell!",

  faqsCat4Q4Title:
    'Is signing a liability release mandatory? Are you playing a legal trick on me?',
  faqsCat4Q4Point1:
    "Not a trick at all; it's an industry standard and for your safety! Yes, signing a standard industry Waiver of Liability and any other required documents is mandatory before starting any diving or adventure activity. It's an acknowledgment of the inherent risks of diving. If you decide not to sign, unfortunately, you won't be able to participate in the experience, and there will be no refund. It's a measure to protect all of us on this adventure!",

  // ----- Category 5: General Information -----
  faqsCat5Title: 'General Information: Things You Might Not Know!',

  faqsCat5Q1Title: 'Is JustDiveCol a physical dive center?',
  faqsCat5Q1Point1:

    "Absolutely! We love creativity and dreams. If you don't find the ideal experience on our calendar, don't hold back! Contact us, and we'll be your adventure architects.

  faqsCat5Q6Title:
    'What if my flight is delayed and I miss part of the experience?',
  faqsCat5Q6Point1:
    "Ugh, that's a classic traveler's nightmare! Unfortunately, JustDiveCol is not responsible for flight delays, transportation cancellations, or other events outside our operation that prevent you from arriving on time. Our itineraries and costs are fixed, so portions of the experience missed due to your delay are non-refundable and non-recoverable. That's why we strongly urge you to consider good travel insurance that covers these eventualities!",

  faqsCat5Q7Title: 'Can I bring my own dive gear?',
  faqsCat5Q7Point1:
    "Absolutely! If you have your own gear and prefer to use it, you're more than welcome. Just make sure it's in perfect condition and up-to-date on its maintenance. If you need to rent anything specific you're missing, we can also help you out. The most important thing is that you feel comfortable and safe underwater!",
