  faqsCat1Title:
    'Courses & Certifications: Your First Splash Towards a New Passion!',

  faqsCat1Q1Title: 'What certification do I need to start diving?',
  faqsCat1Q1Point1:
    "To take your first exciting breaths in recreational diving, the PADI Open Water Diver course is your ticket to the underwater world. It's the most popular certification on the planet and will teach you all the essential fundamentals to dive safely and autonomously down to 18 m / 60 ft deep. Get your fins ready, adventure awaits!",

  faqsCat1Q2Title:
    'What does the price of a certification course with you include?',
  faqsCat1Q2Point1:
    'Our courses are like an all-inclusive combo, designed for your comfort and learning. They generally come with unlimited access to the PADI eLearning® platform, all theoretical and practical sessions (both in confined water and open water), high-quality full equipment rental, accompaniment and supervision from an expert PADI instructor, and dive insurance for the duration of the course. The exact and complete details for each certification can be found in the specific course description. So, no surprises underwater, just pure fun!',

  faqsCat1Q3Title:
    'Do I need to be a fish to dive? Do I have to know how to swim?',
  faqsCat1Q3Point1:
    "You don't need to be an Olympic champion, but yes, you absolutely must know how to swim! You should feel comfortable and safe in the water, and be able to swim 200 m / 650 ft non-stop (or 300 m / 1000 ft with light equipment like a mask and fins) and float for 10 minutes. These requirements are for your own safety and comfort underwater, so if you need to practice those strokes, now's the time!",

  faqsCat1Q4Title: 'What is the minimum age to join the underwater adventure?',
  faqsCat1Q4Point1:
    'For our youngest explorers, the Junior Open Water Diver certification starts from 10 years old. For the "adult" Open Water Diver course and other advanced courses, the minimum age is generally 12 years old or older. Passion for the sea has no age, but safety does have clear requirements to ensure everyone enjoys themselves to the fullest!',

  faqsCat1Q5Title: 'Do I need to see a doctor before diving?',
  faqsCat1Q5Point1:
    'Yes, it\'s an essential "check-up" for your well-being in the ocean. Before any course or dive, you\'ll need to complete a PADI Medical Questionnaire. If you answer "yes" to any question (due to pre-existing conditions, for example), no worries! You\'ll just need a medical authorization signed by a doctor, preferably one specializing in hyperbaric medicine. This is a vital step for your safety, so please review it with ample time.',

  faqsCat1Q6Title: "What if my ears don't equalize well underwater?",
  faqsCat1Q6Point1:
    "It's a common concern; it happens to everyone! Ear equalization is a key skill in diving, and our expert instructors will teach you several effective techniques to do it correctly. If you still experience difficulties, it's crucial to communicate it immediately. In some cases, persistent issues might require a medical consultation. Never force your ears, listen to your body, and always follow your instructor's guidance for a safe and pleasant dive!",

  faqsCat1Q7Title: 'Can I dive if I have asthma or any respiratory condition?',
  faqsCat1Q7Point1:
    "Safety is our absolute top priority. Respiratory conditions like asthma or any other condition affecting your breathing or circulation require a thorough medical evaluation. If you have any of these conditions, it is mandatory that a doctor specializing in hyperbaric medicine authorizes your fitness for diving. Don't take risks; your health is your greatest treasure, and we want you to enjoy diving with complete peace of mind and safety!",

  // ----- Category 2: Dive Trips & Experiences -----
  faqsCat2Title: "Dive Trips & Experiences: Let's Explore the Blue World!",

  faqsCat2Q1Title: 'What types of diving experiences do you offer?',
  faqsCat2Q1Point1:
    "We offer a menu of underwater adventures for all tastes and levels: from thrilling certification trips to postcard-perfect destinations, to advanced experiences for the boldest and most demanding divers. We are passionate about exploring vibrant reefs, mysterious wrecks with history, and unforgettable encounters with the planet's most surprising marine life. Always with excitement and safety as key ingredients in every expedition!",

  faqsCat2Q2Title: 'What level of experience is required for your trips?',
  faqsCat2Q2Point1:
    'We have an adventure for every explorer! We offer experiences tailored for absolute beginners who still "smell of pool chlorine," to advanced divers looking for the next big challenge. It\'s important to note that each experience or dive site has its recommended or required certification level. For example, destinations like Malpelo are exclusive to advanced divers with vast experience in currents and challenging oceanic conditions. There\'s no room for novices (yet!), but plenty for those craving the adrenaline of the big blue!',

  faqsCat2Q3Title:
    'Can I join a trip if I don\'t have a dive buddy? Am I a "Forever Alone" diver?',
  faqsCat2Q3Point1:
    'You are by no means a "Forever Alone" diver! Many of our clients travel solo and find not only great friends underwater but also lifelong companions. We take care of assigning you a certified dive buddy with a similar experience level to yours. This way, we guarantee your safety, enjoyment, and the opportunity to forge new friendships. Here, no one dives alone, unless it\'s their personal desire, such as in recreational technical diving!',

  faqsCat2Q4Title: 'What should I pack for a dive trip? Just fins and go?',
  faqsCat2Q4Point1:
    "Almost! Besides your fins, don't forget the essentials: your PADI certification (or equivalent recognized certification), your updated dive logbook, your personal items (biodegradable, please, to protect the ecosystem), comfortable and quick-drying clothing, swimwear, reef-friendly sunscreen, and if you have it, your personal equipment. In the detailed description of each experience, you'll find a more specific packing list to ensure you don't leave anything behind (or out of your fins) and fully enjoy your adventure.",

  faqsCat2Q5Title:
    'Do you offer custom trips? Can I design my own "à la carte" adventure?',
  faqsCat2Q5Point1:
    "Absolutely! At JustDiveCol, we love creativity and making your wildest underwater dreams come true. If our experience calendar doesn't have that specific adventure that keeps you up at night, don't hold back! Contact us, and we'll be your adventure architects. We can design a private experience or a completely personalized dive trip that perfectly matches your unique interests, certification level, and ideal dates. Your dream, our bubbles, your secret recipe for an unforgettable exploration!",

  // ----- Category 3: Bookings & Payments -----
  faqsCat3Title: 'Bookings & Payments: Secure Your Spot in the Deep Blue!',

  faqsCat3Q1Title: 'How can I book an experience with JustDiveCol?',
  faqsCat3Q1Point1:
    "It's easier than breathing underwater! You can book your adventure directly on our website, by visiting the pages for each course or experience. If you prefer a more personal chat or need advice, don't hesitate to contact us via WhatsApp or email. We'll guide you step-by-step through the entire booking and payment process, with no complications, so you can focus solely on the excitement of diving!",

  faqsCat3Q2Title:
    'What are your payment methods? Do you accept bartering with seashells?',
  faqsCat3Q2Point1:
    'We accept modern and secure payment methods – no seashells for now! You can use our secure payment link for transactions with national credit cards (Visa, Mastercard), debit (PSE), or directly from your Bancolombia or Nequi account. We also accept direct bank transfers to our Bold account. The specific details for your payment will be sent to you clearly and promptly once you confirm your booking. Your peace of mind is our priority!',

  faqsCat3Q3Title:
    'What is your cancellation and refund policy? Is it very strict?',
  faqsCat3Q3Point1:
    "Yes, to be completely transparent, our cancellation and refund policy is strict, and we'll explain why. Imagine we've already invested in logistics: we've purchased the air space for your tank, reserved your spot on the boat, and prepared all the details. Due to the high operational costs and advance planning involved in our experiences and courses, the initial payment is non-refundable. The refund conditions for the remaining amount vary significantly depending on when you cancel (more or less than 30 or 15 days in advance) and if there's a \"No-Show.\" In case of changes due to force majeure (adverse weather conditions, permit restrictions, etc.), our primary solution is to offer a future credit, so you can reschedule your adventure without losing your investment. We strongly encourage you to read our detailed Policies section in the main menu to avoid any doubts. Transparency and your full understanding are key to a trusting relationship and worry-free diving!",

  // ----- Category 4: Safety & Health -----
  faqsCat4Title:
    'Safety & Health: Our Absolute Top Priority Underwater (and Out of It)!',

  faqsCat4Q1Title:
    'What safety measures does JustDiveCol implement? Are you very strict?',
  faqsCat4Q1Point1:
    'More than strict, we are obsessive and methodical about your safety! We implement rigorous protocols based on the highest standards of PADI and DAN (Divers Alert Network). We only use high-quality diving equipment with professional and constant maintenance. Our PADI guides and instructors are super certified, with years of experience, and before each dive, we conduct detailed briefings and thorough equipment checks. Furthermore, we constantly monitor you underwater. We want your only concern to be enjoying yourself to the fullest and diving with absolute peace of mind!',

  faqsCat4Q2Title:
    'Is dive insurance mandatory? What if I get stung by a jellyfish?',
  faqsCat4Q2Point1:
    "Some of our experiences, especially certifications, include dive insurance that specifically covers you for diving-related incidents during the activity. It's an excellent safety net. However, we strongly recommend having additional travel insurance that covers general medical emergencies (like a jellyfish sting, a small scare that can happen!), evacuation, and eventual trip cancellations. JustDiveCol is not responsible for expenses not covered by these policies. Remember, better safe than sorry, and your peace of mind is priceless!",

  faqsCat4Q3Title:
    'What happens if I have a medical emergency during an experience?',
  faqsCat4Q3Point1:
    'Our team is highly trained to act quickly and effectively! All our guides and instructors are certified in first aid and emergency management underwater. In case of any medical situation, we will immediately activate established emergency protocols and seek the most appropriate and nearest medical attention. It is crucial that you inform us about any pre-existing medical conditions before starting the activity, so we can provide you with the best support. Your well-being is our number one siren call and the reason for our utmost attention!',

  faqsCat4Q4Title:
    'Is it mandatory to sign a liability waiver? Are you playing a legal trick on me?',
  faqsCat4Q4Point1:
    "It's absolutely not a trick; it's an industry standard and essential for your safety and everyone else's! Yes, signing a Waiver of Liability and other required documents is mandatory before starting any diving activity. This is an acknowledgment of the inherent risks in diving, which, although controlled, involves certain conditions. If you choose not to sign these documents, unfortunately, you will not be able to participate in the experience, and there will be no refund. It's a necessary measure to protect everyone on this incredible adventure and ensure that we all understand and accept the terms for responsible diving. Transparency is our compass!",

  faqsCat5Q4Title: 'What is your commitment to the marine environment?',
  faqsCat5Q4Point1:
    'We love the ocean with the same intensity as you do! Our commitment to the marine environment is unwavering and profound. We actively promote low-impact diving practices, support marine conservation initiatives locally and globally, and educate all our explorers about the vital importance of protecting underwater ecosystems. We firmly believe that every dive is a unique opportunity to learn, care, and leave the sea better than we found it. We are guardians of the blue and ambassadors for marine sustainability with every bubble we exhale!',

  faqsCat5Q5Title: 'How can I contact you directly?',
