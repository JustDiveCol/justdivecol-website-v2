    'Courses & Certifications: Your First Splash Towards a New Passion!',

  faqFirstCertificationQuestion:
    'What certification do I need to start diving?',
  faqFirstCertificationAnswer:
    "To make your first exciting bubbles in recreational diving, the PADI Open Water Diver course is your passport to the underwater world. It's the most popular certification on the planet and will teach you all the essential fundamentals to dive safely and autonomously up to 18 m (60 ft) deep. Get your fins ready, adventure awaits!", // Standardized depth format

  faqWhatIsIncludedCertificationQuestion:
    'What does the price of a certification course with you include?',
  faqWhatIsIncludedCertificationAnswer:
    'Our courses are like an all-inclusive combo, designed for your convenience and learning. They generally come with unlimited access to the PADI eLearning® platform, all theoretical and practical sessions (both in confined water and open ocean), full top-quality equipment rental, accompaniment and supervision from an expert PADI instructor, and dive insurance for the duration of the course. The exact and complete details for each certification can be found in its specific course description. So, no surprises underwater, just pure fun!',

  faqSwimmingRequirementQuestion:
    'Do I need to be a fish to dive? Do I have to know how to swim?',
  faqSwimmingRequirementAnswer:
    "You don't need to be an Olympic champion, but yes, it is essential to know how to swim! You must be comfortable and confident in the water, and be able to swim 200 m (650 ft) non-stop (or 300 m (1000 ft) with light gear like mask and fins) and float for 10 minutes. These requirements are for your own safety and comfort underwater, so if you need to practice those strokes, now's the time!", // Standardized distance format

  faqMinimunAgeQuestion:
    'What is the minimum age to join the underwater adventure?',
  faqMinimunAgeAnswer:
    'For our youngest explorers, the Junior Open Water Diver certification starts from 10 years old. For the "adult" Open Water Diver course and other advanced courses, the minimum age is generally 12 years or older. The passion for the sea has no age, but safety does have clear requirements to ensure everyone enjoys it to the fullest!',

  faqMedicalRequirementQuestion: 'Do I need to see a doctor before diving?',
  faqMedicalRequirementAnswer:
    'Yes, it\'s an essential "check-up" for your ocean well-being. Before any course or dive, you\'ll need to complete a PADI Medical Questionnaire. If you answer "yes" to any questions (due to pre-existing medical conditions, for example), no worries! You\'ll just need a medical authorization signed by a doctor, preferably one specializing in hyperbaric medicine. This is a vital step for your safety, so please review it well in advance and without rushing.',

  faqAirCompensationQuestion: "What if my ears don't equalize well underwater?",
  faqAirCompensationAnswer:
    "It happens to all of us! Ear equalization is a key skill in diving, and our expert instructors will teach you several effective techniques to do it correctly. If you still experience difficulties, it's crucial to communicate immediately. In some cases, persistent issues might require a medical consultation. Never force your ears; listen to your body and always follow your instructor's guidance for a safe and pleasant dive!",

  faqRespirationIssueQuestion:
    'Can I dive if I have asthma or a respiratory condition?',
  faqRespirationIssueAnswer:
    "Safety is our absolute priority. Respiratory conditions like asthma or any other condition affecting your breathing or circulation require a thorough medical evaluation. If you have any of these conditions, it is mandatory that a specialist hyperbaric physician authorizes your fitness for diving. Don't take risks; your health is your greatest treasure, and we want you to enjoy diving with complete peace of mind and safety!",

It\'s important to note that each experience or dive site has its recommended or required certification level. For example, Malpelo is exclusive to advanced divers with vast experience in currents and challenging oceanic conditions. No room for novices there (yet), but certainly for those who crave the adrenaline of the big blue!',

  faqExperienceAloneQuestion:
    'Can I join a trip if I don\'t have a dive buddy? Am I a "Forever Alone" diver?',
  faqExperienceAloneAnswer:
    'Not a "Forever Alone" diver at all! Many of our clients travel solo and not only find great friends underwater but also lifelong companions. We take care of assigning you a certified dive buddy with a similar experience level to yours. This way, we guarantee your safety, enjoyment, and the opportunity to forge new friendships. Here, no one dives alone, unless it\'s their personal wish, as in recreational technical diving!',

  faqExperiencePackingQuestion:
    'What should I pack for a dive trip? Just fins and go?',
  faqExperiencePackingAnswer:
    "Almost! Don't forget your PADI certification (or equivalent recognized), your updated dive logbook, personal items (please, make them biodegradable to protect the ecosystem), comfortable and quick-drying clothes, swimwear, reef-friendly sunscreen, and if you have it, your personal diving gear. In the detailed description of each experience, you'll find a more specific packing list so you don't leave anything out of your suitcase (or your fins) and fully enjoy your adventure.",

  faqBookingAndPaymentPoliciesQuestion:
    'What is your cancellation and refund policy? Is it super strict?',
  faqBookingAndPaymentPoliciesAnswer:
    "Yes, to be completely transparent, our cancellation and refund policy is strict, and we'll explain why. Imagine we've already invested in logistics: we've bought the air space for your tank, booked your spot on the boat, and prepared all the details. Due to the high operational costs and advance planning involved in our experiences and courses, the initial payment is non-refundable. Conditions for refunding the remaining amount vary significantly depending on when you cancel (more or less than 30 or 15 days in advance) and if you don't show up (No-Show). For changes due to force majeure (adverse weather conditions, permit restrictions, etc.), the main solution is to offer future credit. We strongly encourage you to read our detailed Policies section in the main menu so there are no doubts. Transparency and your full understanding are key to a trusting relationship and worry-free diving!",

    'Safety & Health: Our Top Priority Underwater (and out of it)!',

  faqSafetyAndHealthMeasuresQuestion:
    'What safety measures does JustDiveCol implement? Are they super strict?',
  faqSafetyAndHealthMeasuresAnswer:
    "More than strict, we're obsessive and methodical about your safety! We implement rigorous protocols based on the highest standards of PADI and DAN (Divers Alert Network).

We want your only concern to be enjoying yourself to the fullest and diving with absolute peace of mind!",

  faqSafetyAndHealthInsuranceQuestion:
    'Is dive insurance mandatory? What if a jellyfish stings me?',
  faqSafetyAndHealthInsuranceAnswer:
    "Some of our experiences, especially certifications, include dive insurance that specifically covers incidents related to the diving activity for its duration. It's an excellent backup. However, we strongly recommend having additional travel insurance that covers general medical emergencies (like a jellyfish sting, a small scare that can happen!), evacuation, and cancellations. JustDiveCol is not responsible for expenses not covered by the specific dive policy or by your own insurance. Remember, better safe than sorry, and your peace of mind is priceless!",

  faqSafetyAndHealthEmergencyQuestion:
    'What happens if I have a medical emergency during an experience?',
  faqSafetyAndHealthEmergencyAnswer:
    'Our team is highly trained to act quickly and effectively! All our guides and instructors are trained in first aid and emergency management. In case of any medical situation, emergency protocols will be activated, and appropriate medical attention will be sought. It is crucial that you inform us about any pre-existing medical conditions before starting the activity, so we can provide you with the best support. Your well-being is our number one alarm bell and the reason for our utmost attention!',

  faqSafetyAndHealthLiabilityQuestion:
    'Is signing a liability release mandatory? Are you playing a legal trick on me?',
  faqSafetyAndHealthLiabilityAnswer:
    "Not a trick at all; it's an industry standard and essential for your safety and everyone's! Yes, signing a standard industry Waiver of Liability and any other required documents is mandatory before starting any diving or adventure activity. It's an acknowledgment of the inherent risks of diving. If you decide not to sign these documents, unfortunately, you won't be able to participate in the experience, and there will be no refund. It's a measure to protect all of us in this incredible adventure and ensure everyone understands and accepts the terms for responsible diving. Transparency is our compass!",
