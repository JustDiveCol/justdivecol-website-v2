    'To confirm your spot in any of our experiences, a non-refundable initial payment is required, the value of which may vary by experience. This payment covers the purchase and activation of certification materials (when applicable for courses), which remain valid for 12 months to complete your course with us or any PADI dive center or professional. This initial payment is essential to secure your place and the necessary resources for your adventure.',
  policies1Point2:
    'The remaining balance must be paid by the deadline indicated at the time of booking, which varies by experience, being at most 15 days before the start of the trip or activity. Our team will provide you with all payment details clearly and promptly.',
  policiesSection1Point3:
    'Your spot is considered reserved only once the initial payment has been received and confirmed by JustDiveCol. In case the final payment is not received within the established timeframe, we reserve the right to release your spot, and the initial payment will be forfeited in its entirety, as it covers operational planning costs.',

  policiesSection2Point2a:
    'If JustDiveCol is forced to modify or cancel an experience due to adverse weather conditions, lack of navigation permits, operational safety, or any other force majeure cause beyond our control, a credit for a future experience will be offered. The value of this credit may vary depending on the case and non-recoverable operational costs. This credit will be valid for 12 months from the original activity date.',
  policiesSection2Point2b:

    'Cancellations due to unforeseen medical conditions (prior to the activity) preventing the diver from participating, and duly certified by a doctor, will be evaluated individually. In these cases, a credit for a future date, valid for 12 months, may be offered, but only if cancellation is notified more than 30 days in advance. This credit will be partial and subject to the deduction of all non-recoverable operational costs already incurred. In any other case of medical cancellation with less notice, no refund or credit will apply. Please consider purchasing robust travel insurance to cover such eventualities.',

    'JustDiveCol reserves the absolute right to deny service or participation in a dive to any diver who, in the judgment of our certified staff, is deemed not to meet safety requirements, is under the influence of substances, or may compromise their safety or that of others. We prioritize the safety of the entire group.',
  policiesSection3Point5:
    "Insurance Coverage: Some of our experiences, especially certifications, include dive insurance that specifically covers incidents related to the diving activity for its duration. However, we strongly recommend having additional travel insurance that offers broader coverage for general medical emergencies, evacuation, and trip cancellation, as JustDiveCol is not responsible for expenses arising from incidents not covered by the specific dive policy or the client's own insurance. Your complete peace of mind is our goal.",
