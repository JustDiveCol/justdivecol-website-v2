  panelesSmName: 'Panelés (Dos Morritos) - Tayrona National Natural Park',
  panelesSmDescriptionP1:
    'Prepare for a dive only for the boldest at Panelés (Dos Morritos), a challenging dive site in Tayrona National Natural Park, exclusive for highly experienced and technical divers. Here, rock pinnacles battered by intense oceanic currents await you, offering the incredible opportunity to "fly" between underwater formations. This is the epicenter of pelagic life, where massive schools and large predatory fish will take your breath away. An extreme adventure that only elite divers can fully enjoy!',
  panelesSmDescriptionP2:
    "Located on the western side of Isla Aguja, this site consists of a pair of rock formations that barely peek above the surface. The constant force of the currents, far from being an obstacle, is a blessing that brings a huge amount of nutrients, allowing the rocks to be carpeted by an infinity of marine species—including corals, sponges, and anemones—thriving in these extreme conditions, creating an incredibly productive and dense ecosystem. It is one of the most interesting sites for observing larger fish, as schools of jacks, snappers, good-sized barracudas, and other pelagic fish frequently visit the area, actively feeding in the current. Occasionally, sea turtles may also be spotted passing by. Visibility is usually very clear (15-25+ m / 50-80+ ft) due to the constant renewal of oceanic water, although the current's force itself can create surface turbulence. Depths range from 5-8 m / 15-25 ft at the top of the rocks, descending to over 30 m / 100 ft at the base on deep sandy bottoms.",
