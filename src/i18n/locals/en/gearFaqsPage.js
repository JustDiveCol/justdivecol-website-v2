    'What do I do if my BCD leaks air slowly and constantly?',
  faqBCDLeakTroubleshootAnswer:
    "First, check the dump valves and inflator to clear any sand or sediment that might be preventing a perfect seal. If the leak persists, take your BCD to a certified technical service center. It likely needs O-rings replaced or the inflator mechanism repaired. Do not use it if it's leaking air; your safety comes first!",

  // ---------- FAQs Protection ----------
  faqsSectionThermalTitle:
    'Thermal Protection & Comfort: Dive Always at Your Ideal Temperature',

  faqNeedOwnWetsuitCaribbeanQuestion:
    'Do I really need to buy a personal wetsuit for diving in the Caribbean?',
  faqNeedOwnWetsuitCaribbeanAnswer:
    "It's not essential due to the warm Caribbean water temperature, but it is highly recommended for personal hygiene. Rental suits can retain residue and bacteria. Owning a shorty or a 1-3 mm wetsuit ensures cleanliness, comfort, and a perfect fit, significantly enhancing your underwater experience.",

  faqGlovesProhibitedQuestion: 'Are gloves and hoods prohibited in some reefs?',
  faqGlovesProhibitedAnswer:

Always check the local regulations of your destination. If you only seek thermal protection for your head or hair, opt for a thin neoprene neck gaiter or hood, which doesn't impact the ecosystem.",

  faqShortyVsFullQuestion:
    "What's the main difference between a shorty and a full wetsuit?",
  faqShortyVsFullAnswer:
    'A shorty covers the torso, arms to the elbows, and thighs, making it ideal for tropical and warm waters (27-30 째C / 80-86 째F) where minimal thermal protection is needed. A full wetsuit insulates the entire body (arms and legs), being essential in temperate or cold waters (below 25 째C / 77 째F) or for prolonged dives, offering greater protection against scrapes and the sun.',

  faqDryWetsuitQuestion: 'How do I dry my wetsuit without deforming it?',
  faqDryWetsuitAnswer:
    'To properly dry your wetsuit and extend its lifespan, hang it inside out on a wide, sturdy hanger, ideally one designed for wetsuits.

  faqSMBVSDSMBQuestion: 'Is it worth investing in a DSMB instead of an SMB?',
  faqSMBVSDSMBAnswer:
    'Yes, definitely. A DSMB (Delayed Surface Marker Buoy) is inflated underwater, incorporates an overpressure relief valve, and is generally longer and more visible, offering greater safety for marking your position during a controlled ascent. An SMB (Surface Marker Buoy) is inflated on the surface and is more basic. For advanced divers, the DSMB is a superior safety tool.',

  faqNeedOwnTankQuestion:
    'Is it truly necessary to own a tank if I travel frequently for diving?',
  faqNeedOwnTankAnswer:
    "For most occasional or traveling divers, it's usually more economical and practical to rent tanks at each destination. Only consider buying your own tank if you dive very frequently in your local city and transportation isn't an issue. Rental and filling costs are generally more manageable than the transportation and ownership of a personal tank.",

  faqWhenToInflateDSMBQuestion:
    'When should I inflate my DSMB: on the bottom or at the surface?',
  faqWhenToInflateDSMBAnswer:
    'If your goal is to signal your position during a controlled ascent (e.g., to indicate your safety stop or if you get separated from the group), you should inflate your DSMB on the bottom (Delayed Surface Marker Buoy). On the surface, you would simply use it as an SMB (Surface Marker Buoy) to mark your position if you need to be picked up by the boat. Underwater inflation requires practice and is a crucial skill.',

  faqDSMBLeakTestQuestion: 'How do I check if my DSMB has leaks before a dive?',
  faqDSMBLeakTestAnswer:
    "To check if your DSMB has leaks, fully inflate it before your dive and let it sit for 24 hours. If it loses pressure during this period, carefully check the inflation valve and seams for bubbles or damage. It's crucial to fix any leaks before using it underwater, as its functionality is vital for your safety and signaling.",

  // ---------- FAQs Lights and Tools ----------
  faqsSectionLightingToolsTitle:
    'Lighting & Tools: Always Ready for Exploration & Safety',

  faqTorchUseAnswer:
    "Even in daylight, an underwater flashlight is essential. It's crucial in murky waters or inside wrecks and caves to see details and to restore the vibrant colors that water absorbs. Furthermore, it's vital for effectively communicating with your buddy or group. Never dive without one!",

  faqTorchBackupQuestion:
    'Is it better to use a main and a backup flashlight, or just one very powerful one?',
  faqTorchBackupAnswer:
    'Ideally, carry a powerful main flashlight and a more compact backup. This setup provides crucial redundancy against potential battery failures or impacts to the main light. Additionally, the secondary light can be useful for quick signaling or illuminating details without blinding marine life, increasing your safety and versatility.',

  faqKnifeVsCutterQuestion:
    'Is it mandatory to carry a dive knife, or is a line cutter sufficient?',
  faqKnifeVsCutterAnswer:
    'A compact line cutter made of titanium or ceramic is generally sufficient and more practical for most entanglement emergencies (e.g., fishing nets or thin lines). Avoid large knives that add weight, drag, and can be misinterpreted. A line cutter is safer and more efficient for its primary purpose: quickly and controllably cutting lines.',

  faqCutterMaterialQuestion:
    'What is the best material for a dive line cutter?',
  faqCutterMaterialAnswer:
    'The ideal materials for a line cutter are titanium or ceramic. Both exceptionally resist marine corrosion (unlike stainless steel, which requires more care) and maintain their edge without frequent sharpening. Ceramic is especially valued for its edge durability.',

  // ---------- FAQs Transport and Maintenance ----------
  faqsSectionTransportMaintenanceTitle:
    "Transport & Maintenance: Protect Your Investment & Extend Your Gear's Life",

  faqKitRepairValueQuestion:
    'Is it useful to carry a quick repair kit for my gear on a trip?',
  faqKitRepairValueAnswer:
    'Absolutely! A compact set with O-rings, hose clamps, and basic hoses allows you to patch minor leaks or fix simple issues on-site. This can prevent costly interruptions in remote destinations and ensure you keep enjoying your dives without setbacks.',

  faqDefogDIYQuestion: 'Can I really make my own homemade defog for my mask?',
  faqDefogDIYAnswer:
    'Totally! It\'s an economical and effective solution. You can mix baby soap or "No More Tears" shampoo 50/50 with water in a small spray bottle. Apply a thin layer to the inside of your mask, rub gently, and rinse lightly with water before the dive. Goodbye fog, hello crystal-clear visibility!',

  faqOverweightAvoidanceQuestion:
    'How can I avoid overweight charges when traveling by plane with my dive bag?',
  faqOverweightAvoidanceAnswer:
    'To avoid overweight charges, invest in a lightweight bag with compression straps and weigh all your gear before departing. A useful strategy is to carry weights and booties in a separate mesh bag that you can easily remove at check-in if necessary. Distributing gear between your carry-on and checked luggage also helps balance the weight.',

  faqZipperLubricationQuestion:
    'How often should I lubricate my wetsuit and BCD zippers?',
  faqZipperLubricationAnswer:
    'To extend the lifespan and ensure smooth operation of your wetsuit and BCD zippers (especially dry or waterproof ones), apply marine-grade silicone lubricant every 5-10 dives, or before long trips. This prevents sticking, corrosion, and water entry.',

  faqBagMeshUseQuestion: 'Why do I need a mesh bag for wet gear after diving?',
  faqBagMeshUseAnswer:
    'A mesh bag is essential because it allows your dive gear to drain and partially dry on the go, preventing moisture buildup and odors. It also keeps your wet, sandy gear separate from your dry luggage and helps keep your main bag clean, simplifying post-dive transport.',
